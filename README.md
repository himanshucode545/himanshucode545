### Driver Drowsiness Detection

Developed a drowsiness detection system using OpenCV for image and video processing tasks. Implemented face detection and facial landmark localization using dlib's pre-trained models. Utilized NumPy for numerical operations and array manipulation, enhancing the efficiency of facial landmark processing. Evaluated the performance of the system using metrics provided by scikit-learn.

Features:
- Real-time detection of driver drowsiness
- High accuracy in recognizing eye and facial patterns
- Robust performance under varying lighting conditions
- Easy integration with existing vehicle monitoring systems
